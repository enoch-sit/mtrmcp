## 🎯 Demonstration Complete!

All key LangSmith evaluation concepts have been successfully demonstrated in `langsmith_eval_advanced.py`.

---

## ✅ Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. **Datasets** 📊
- **Created**: "Math Calculator QA" dataset
- **Examples**: 4 test cases with inputs and expected outputs
- **Content**: Math questions requiring calculator tools + one conversational example
- **Metadata**: Each example includes `should_use_tool` and `expected_tool` flags

```python
examples = [
    {"question": "What is 15 plus 27?", "answer": "42", "expected_tool": "add"},
    {"question": "Calculate 8 times 7", "answer": "56", "expected_tool": "multiply"},
    {"question": "What is 100 divided by 4?", "answer": "25", "expected_tool": "divide"},
    {"question": "Hello, how are you?", "answer": "conversational", "expected_tool": None}
]
```

---

### 2. **Tool Usage & Trajectory Evaluation** 📐
- **Tools Created**: 
  - `add(a, b)` - Addition
  - `multiply(a, b)` - Multiplication
  - `divide(a, b)` - Division with zero-check
  
- **Trajectory Tracking**:
  - Captures each step: user message → LLM response → tool call → tool result
  - Records tool name, arguments, and results
  - Enables evaluation of correct tool usage

- **Trajectory Evaluator**:
  - Checks if the correct tool was used
  - Verifies tools weren't used unnecessarily
  - Scores based on expected behavior

```python
trajectory = [
    {"step": "initial", "type": "user_message", "content": "What is 15 plus 27?"},
    {"step": "llm_response_0", "type": "ai_message", "tool_calls": 1},
    {"step": "tool_call_0", "type": "tool_call", "tool": "add", "args": {"a": 15, "b": 27}, "result": 42}
]
```

### 3. **A/B Testing with Different System Prompts** 🤖

#### Variant A: Formal System Prompt
```python
"You are a precise mathematical assistant. 
When asked to perform calculations, you MUST use the available calculator tools.
Always use tools for arithmetic operations. Be formal and concise."
```

#### Variant B: Friendly System Prompt
```python
"You are a friendly and helpful math tutor! 
When someone asks you to calculate something, use your calculator tools to help them out.
Use tools for math operations and explain your steps in a warm, encouraging way."
```

**A/B Test Results**:
- Both variants created using factory function `create_agent(system_prompt)`
- Each ran as separate experiment with metadata tagging
- Results can be compared in LangSmith UI

### 4. **Multiple Evaluator Types** 📏

#### a) **Correctness Evaluator** (String Match)
- Checks if expected numerical answer appears in response
- Binary score: 1 if correct, 0 if not

#### b) **Tool Usage Evaluator** (Trajectory)
- Validates correct tool was called when needed
- Checks tools weren't called unnecessarily
- Examines the execution trajectory

#### c) **LLM-as-Judge Evaluator** (Helpfulness)
- Uses AWS Bedrock LLM to evaluate response quality
- Rates helpfulness on 0-1 scale
- Provides reasoning in comments

```python
judge_prompt = f"""You are evaluating an AI assistant's response for helpfulness.

Question: {question}
Response: {response}

Rate the helpfulness on a scale of 0-1:
- 1.0: Very helpful, clear, and answers the question well
- 0.5: Somewhat helpful but could be clearer
- 0.0: Not helpful or confusing

Respond with ONLY a number between 0 and 1"""
```

#### d) **Response Length Evaluator**
- Checks if response is appropriately concise
- Optimal range: 20-200 characters
- Penalizes too-short or too-long responses

---

### 5. **Experiments** 🧪

#### Experiment A: "math-agent-formal"
- **Agent**: Formal system prompt variant
- **Evaluators**: All 4 evaluators
- **Metadata**:
  - Model: amazon.nova-lite-v1:0
  - System prompt: "formal"
  - Variant: "A"
  - Temperature: 0.7

#### Experiment B: "math-agent-friendly"
- **Agent**: Friendly system prompt variant
- **Evaluators**: All 4 evaluators
- **Metadata**:
  - Model: amazon.nova-lite-v1:0
  - System prompt: "friendly"
  - Variant: "B"
  - Temperature: 0.7

**Benefits**:
- Repeatable testing with consistent dataset
- Track performance over time
- Compare different approaches systematically

---

### 6. **Comparative Evaluation** ⚖️

- **Purpose**: Direct A/B comparison between experiments
- **Method**: LLM-as-judge pairwise comparison
- **Evaluator**: Preference evaluator that compares responses

```python
def preference_evaluator(runs, example):
    """Compare two responses and determine which is better."""
    # LLM judges: "Which response is better? A, B, or TIE"
    # Returns scores for both variants
```

**Note**: Comparative evaluation API varies by SDK version. Manual comparison available in LangSmith UI at the provided URLs.

---

### 7. **Metadata Tracking** 🏷️

Each experiment tagged with:
- **Model version**: `amazon.nova-lite-v1:0`
- **System prompt type**: `formal` or `friendly`
- **Variant identifier**: `A` or `B`
- **Temperature**: `0.7`
- **Description**: Human-readable experiment purpose

**Benefits**:
- Filter experiments by metadata
- Understand what changed between runs
- Reproducibility for future reference
